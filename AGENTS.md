# Tool Rules (compose-agentsmd)

- **Session gate**: before responding to ANY user message, run `compose-agentsmd` from the project root. AGENTS.md contains the rules you operate under; stale rules cause rule violations. If you discover you skipped this step mid-session, stop, run it immediately, re-read the diff, and adjust your behavior before continuing.
- `compose-agentsmd` intentionally regenerates `AGENTS.md`; any resulting `AGENTS.md` diff is expected and must not be treated as an unexpected external change.
- If `compose-agentsmd` is not available, run it via `npx compose-agentsmd`. If `npx` is unavailable or cannot fetch the package, install it via npm with an environment-appropriate method such as `npm install -g compose-agentsmd` when global installs are permitted, or a user-local npm prefix when global installs are not permitted.
- To update shared/global rules, use `compose-agentsmd edit-rules` to locate the writable rules workspace, make changes only in that workspace, then run `compose-agentsmd apply-rules` (do not manually clone or edit the rules source repo outside this workflow).
- If you find an existing clone of the rules source repo elsewhere, do not assume it is the correct rules workspace; always treat `compose-agentsmd edit-rules` output as the source of truth.
- `compose-agentsmd apply-rules` pushes the rules workspace when `source` is GitHub (if the workspace is clean), then regenerates `AGENTS.md` with refreshed rules.
- Do not edit `AGENTS.md` directly; update the source rules and regenerate.
- `tools/tool-rules.md` is the shared rule source for all repositories that use compose-agentsmd.
- Before applying any rule updates, present the planned changes first with an ANSI-colored diff-style preview, ask for explicit approval, then make the edits.
- These tool rules live in tools/tool-rules.md in the compose-agentsmd repository; do not duplicate them in other rule modules.

- To regenerate the JavaScript SDK, run `./packages/sdk/js/script/build.ts`.
- ALWAYS USE PARALLEL TOOLS WHEN APPLICABLE.
- The default branch in this repo is `dev`.
- Local `main` ref may not exist; use `dev` or `origin/dev` for diffs.
- Prefer automation: execute requested actions without confirmation unless blocked by missing info or safety/irreversibility.

## Style Guide

### General Principles

- Keep things in one function unless composable or reusable
- Avoid `try`/`catch` where possible
- Avoid using the `any` type
- Use Bun APIs when possible, like `Bun.file()`
- Rely on type inference when possible; avoid explicit type annotations or interfaces unless necessary for exports or clarity
- Prefer functional array methods (flatMap, filter, map) over for loops; use type guards on filter to maintain type inference downstream

Reduce total variable count by inlining when a value is only used once.

```ts
// Good
const journal = await Bun.file(path.join(dir, "journal.json")).json()

// Bad
const journalPath = path.join(dir, "journal.json")
const journal = await Bun.file(journalPath).json()
```

### Destructuring

Avoid unnecessary destructuring. Use dot notation to preserve context.

```ts
// Good
obj.a
obj.b

// Bad
const { a, b } = obj
```

### Variables

Prefer `const` over `let`. Use ternaries or early returns instead of reassignment.

```ts
// Good
const foo = condition ? 1 : 2

// Bad
let foo
if (condition) foo = 1
else foo = 2
```

### Control Flow

Avoid `else` statements. Prefer early returns.

```ts
// Good
function foo() {
  if (condition) return 1
  return 2
}

// Bad
function foo() {
  if (condition) return 1
  else return 2
}
```

### Schema Definitions (Drizzle)

Use snake_case for field names so column names don't need to be redefined as strings.

```ts
// Good
const table = sqliteTable("session", {
  id: text().primaryKey(),
  project_id: text().notNull(),
  created_at: integer().notNull(),
})

// Bad
const table = sqliteTable("session", {
  id: text("id").primaryKey(),
  projectID: text("project_id").notNull(),
  createdAt: integer("created_at").notNull(),
})
```

## Testing

- Avoid mocks as much as possible
- Test actual implementation, do not duplicate logic into tests
- Tests cannot run from repo root (guard: `do-not-run-tests-from-root`); run from package dirs like `packages/opencode`.

## Type Checking

- Always run `bun typecheck` from package directories (e.g., `packages/opencode`), never `tsc` directly.

# High-quality OpenCode workflow

- Repository-local OpenCode workflows MUST live in `.opencode/commands/`.
- The canonical verification command MUST be the same command used for local validation before delivery.
- When no canonical verification command is configured, the agent MUST stop and report the missing bootstrap requirement instead of inventing a partial substitute.
- Bug fixes MUST add or strengthen a regression check before concluding.
- Irreversible operations such as destructive deletion, publish, release, force-push, or external side effects MUST remain approval-gated.
